    Business is booming! I have so many customers I can't handle it; I need to automate some of the boring parts of my job and know the little details won't slip through the cracks. I want an interactive app to <span>IMPRESS</span><br /> the world, providing tools to make life easier for my customers (and me!). I need my own eCommerce site, a custom app to keep my operations running smoothly, or have a bunch of customers clamoring for something.

<div class="toplevel" id="low">
    I'm starting a small business or new project. I'm excited to get the word out and I want my website to show how awesome I am (pretty awesome!) but I'm worried about getting in over my head. I want to stay small and <span>SCRAPPY</span><br /> and use the web as efficiently as possible. Most of my new customers will be from my network or through word of mouth, so I definitely need a website so people can get in touch with me and pass my info along to their friends.
</div>

<div class="toplevel" id="mid">
    My business has been growing but I want to do more. I need to keep clients in the loop about new services and want to start sharing some insight with the world to show potential customers that I know my stuff. I need a professional and <span>POLISHED</span><br /> web presence to help me push my reputation past the boundaries of my network. But I don't have the time or desire to spend a lot of time on a website - I need to focus on my business!
