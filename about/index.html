        <b>Chris Doyle</b> has been writing software for the web since he was 12, because clearly no 12-year-old's website is complete without a guestbook. Since then he has earned a degree from Olin College and begun making his way in the professional world at <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com">Smartsheet</a> and <a href="http://www.evri.com">Evri</a>. He now brings his expertise with Rails, Java, AJAX, Javascript, and oh-so-many other technologies to the freelance world, where he hopes to make the internet a little better and easier one site at a time. Chris has been described as a "young hotshot" and "exceptionally patient" and looks forward to patiently sharing his alleged talent with anyone who wants their website to just work.
