    <p>The WorryFree&trade; Guarantee:</p>
    
    <p><i>You will never have to think about your website unless you want to</i>.
    </p>
    
    <p>You have better things to think about than the technical details of your website. The last thing you need is another thing going wrong, another thing keeping you awake at night, another mess to clean up. Let us worry about it for you.
    </p>

    <p>We are always happy to talk with you on the phone, in person, or over email. We want you to be 100% confident in our work and your website. We try hard to make sure we walk you through your options and the work we do for you, but if at any point you're confused, dissatisfied, or in any way less than thrilled - get in touch.
    </p>
    
    <p>If it's broken, we fix it. If it isn't right, we fix it. If you don't like it, we fix it. It's that simple.
